# ResponsiveTravel

This is the submission for the Responsive Design assignment in CIS-130

The viewport changes are there and do change the website design, though admittedly feels more like changes artistically than the overall design of the webpage as I'd like,
due to elements constantly breaking and overwriting when I did try to do new elements.

Overall, still proud of the work I made, and took multiple days of work and trial and error to get where I had it.
